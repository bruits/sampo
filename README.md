Automate changelogs, versioning, and publishingâ€”even for monorepos across multiple package registries. Deeply inspired by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Enforce [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) across all packages.
