Automate changelogs, versioning, and publishingâ€”even for monorepos across multiple package registries. Currently supported ecosystems: Rust ([Crates.io](https://crates.io))... And more [coming soon](https://github.com/bruits/sampo/issues/104)!

Don't know where to start? Check out Sampo's [Getting Started](./crates/sampo/README.md#getting-started) guide.

## Crates

Sampo is a monorepo that contains the following crates (Rust packages):

| Name                  | Description                                                   | Registry                                                                                                                                                               | README                                           |

## Acknowledgements

Sampo is deeply inspired by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), but made with Rust and designed for multi-ecosystems monorepos.

Sampo uses Knope's [changesets](https://github.com/knope-dev/changesets) crate to parse changeset files. [Knope](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope) is another Rust project inspired by Changesets, we highly recommend checking it out!

Sampo uses and enforces [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer), like their standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version format and the "Version Bumps" concepts.

Sampo is an open-source project born from [Bruits](https://github.com/bruits), a Rust-focused collective, and lives thanks to its [contributors](https://github.com/bruits/sampo/graphs/contributors) ðŸ’›
