While in pre-release mode, you can continue to add changesets and run `sampo release` and `sampo publish` as usual, Sampo preserves the consumed changesets in `.sampo/prerelease/`. When exiting pre-release mode or switching to a different label (for example, from `alpha` to `beta`), any preserved changesets are restored back to `.sampo/changesets/`, so the next release keeps the full history.
