Add a `[git]` configuration section that defines the default release branch (default to `"main"`) and the full set of branch names allowed to run `sampo release` or `sampo publish`. The CLI and GitHub Action now detect the current branch (or respect `SAMPO_RELEASE_BRANCH`) and abort early when the branch is not whitelisted, enabling parallel maintenance lines such as `main` and `3.x` without cross-contamination.
