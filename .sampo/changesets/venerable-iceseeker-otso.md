Added support for pre-release identifiers such as `1.8.0-alpha` or `2.0.0-rc.3`. While a pre-release stays within its implied level (patch for `x.y.z-prerelease`, minor for `x.y.0-prerelease`, major for `x.0.0-prerelease`), we only bump the numeric suffix (`alpha` → `alpha.1` -> `alpha.2` -> etc). If a higher bump is required, we advance the base version first and reset the numeric suffix (`1.8.0-alpha.2` + major → `2.0.0-alpha`). Purely numeric tags like `1.0.0-1` are rejected.
