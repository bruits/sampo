## Sampo's GitHub Action

GitHub Action to run Sampo (release and/or publish) in GitHub Actions.

### Usage

Minimal example (release only):

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Sampo release
        uses: bruits/sampo/crates/sampo-github-action@main
        with:
          command: release
```

Release then publish (requires a crates.io token):

```yaml
name: Release & Publish
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  release_publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Sampo release & publish
        uses: bruits/sampo/crates/sampo-github-action@main
        with:
          command: release-and-publish
          cargo-token: ${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
          # Optional: pass flags to cargo publish (after `--`)
          args: --allow-dirty --no-verify
```

Prepare a Release PR on push (recommended):

```yaml
name: Prepare Release PR
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: write
  discussions: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  release_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Open/refresh Release PR
        uses: bruits/sampo/crates/sampo-github-action@main
        with:
          command: prepare-pr
          # optional overrides (defaults shown):
          # base-branch: main
          # pr-branch: release/sampo
          # pr-title: Release
        env:
          # Default token is available automatically; ensure permissions above are set
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Publish after the Release PR is merged (optionally create GitHub releases):

```yaml
name: Publish After Merge
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  publish:
    # Only run when the Release PR (created by prepare-pr) is merged
    if: >
      github.event.pull_request.merged == true &&
      github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main' &&
      (
        startsWith(github.event.pull_request.head.ref, 'release/') ||
        contains(github.event.pull_request.title, 'Release')
      )
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
      - name: Publish crates (and create tags)
        uses: bruits/sampo/crates/sampo-github-action@main
        with:
          command: post-merge-publish
          cargo-token: ${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
          # optional: also create GitHub Releases for new tags
          create-github-release: true
          # optional: open a GitHub Discussion per release
          open-discussion: true
          # optional: preferred discussions category slug (falls back gracefully)
          discussion-category: announcements
          # optional: upload a compiled binary to GitHub releases (only for binary crates)
          upload-binary: true
          # optional: specify binary name (defaults to crate name)
          binary-name: sampo
          # optional: build and upload binaries for multiple targets in one run
          # targets: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, x86_64-apple-darwin, x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
          # optional: pass flags to cargo publish
          args: --allow-dirty --no-verify
```

Notes:

- prepare-pr runs `sampo release` on a release branch and opens/updates a PR.
- post-merge-publish runs only when the Release PR is merged into `main`. It creates any missing tags for the current crate versions on the main branch, pushes them, and runs `sampo publish`. It can also create GitHub Releases for the new tags.
- Adjust the branch/title condition in the workflow if you customize the release PR branch name.
- Ensure the workflow has `contents: write` (and `pull-requests: write` for prepare-pr) permissions. To open Discussions, also grant `discussions: write` and enable Discussions in the repository settings.
- When `upload-binary` is enabled, the action uploads binaries only for crates that define a binary target (e.g., `src/main.rs`, `src/bin/*`, or `[[bin]]` in `Cargo.toml`). Pure library crates are skipped automatically.
 - For multi-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows), you have two options:
   - Run the `post-merge-publish` job on an OS matrix so each runner builds its native binary.
   - Or set `targets` to a list of Rust target triples to cross-compile in one job (requires those targets and linkers to be installed).

### Inputs

- `command`: `release`, `publish`, `release-and-publish`, `prepare-pr`, or `post-merge-publish` (default: `release-and-publish`)
- `dry-run`: if `true`, simulates changes without writing or publishing (default: `false`)
- `working-directory`: path to workspace root (defaults to `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`)
- `cargo-token`: crates.io API token; when set, exported as `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
- `args`: extra flags forwarded to `cargo publish` via `sampo publish -- â€¦`
- `base-branch`: base branch used by the Release PR (prepare-pr)
- `pr-branch`: working branch used for the Release PR (prepare-pr)
- `pr-title`: title of the Release PR (prepare-pr)
- `create-github-release`: if `true`, create GitHub Releases for new tags (post-merge-publish)
- `open-discussion`: if `true`, create a GitHub Discussion for each created release (post-merge-publish)
- `discussion-category`: preferred Discussions category slug (default preference: `announcements` when available)
- `upload-binary`: if `true`, upload a binary asset when creating GitHub releases (only for crates with a binary target). The binary is built for the host runner target and the asset name includes the target triple.
- `binary-name`: override binary name (defaults to the crate name or the single `[[bin]]` name when unambiguous)
- `targets`: space- or comma-separated Rust target triples to build and upload (must already be installed via `rustup target add ...`). If omitted, only the host target is built.
- `github-token`: GitHub token to create/update PRs (defaults to `GITHUB_TOKEN` env)

### Outputs

- `released`: "true" if the release step executed successfully
- `published`: "true" if the publish step executed successfully
